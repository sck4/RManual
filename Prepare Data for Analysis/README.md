## Did you know that about 80 percent of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data? 
# To alleviate and simplify this effort, this folder contains scripts to:
Create a balanced panel dataset
Transform the data between long and wide format
Transform questions for information only into numeric variables, containing data on key factory characteristics
When a question has changed overtime, to converge multiple questions and choose its latest formulation as the question label
Merge different data sources, specifically assessment and social dialogue data

These steps are not exhaustive, and readers are encouraged to seek additional guidance to supplement this information with statistics or econometrics manuals
