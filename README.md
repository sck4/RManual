A partnership between the UN's International Labour Organization and the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, Better Work brings diverse groups together - governments, global trends, factory owners, and union workers - to improve working conditions in the garment industry and make the sector more competitive.

Our approach creates lasting, positive change through assessments, trainings, advocacy and research that changes policies, attitudes, as well as behaviour. By sharing our approach and the results of our on-the-ground work, we seek to influence policy makers and decision makers to promote decent work and better business.
