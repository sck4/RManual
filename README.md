# Who we are

A partnership between the UN's International Labour Organization and the International Finance Corporation, a member of the World Bank Group, Better Work brings diverse groups together - governments, global trends, factory owners, and union workers - to improve working conditions in the garment industry and make the sector more competitive.

In order to achieve this, the programme works to improve conditions in individual factories while also leveraging its learnings for policy change at both the national and international levels. Factory services combine enterprise assessments of compliance with labour standards, with training and advisory services at the factory level.

## Research
Research and collaboration are integral to expanding the reach of Better Work and measure the impact of improved working conditions on workers’ wellbeing, business profits, and communities at large. For this reason, Better Work collects a wealth of factory-level information through its ongoing operations – this data tracks the progress factories make over time in improving compliance with international labour standards and national laws, the type of specialized training the factory invests in, and the extent to which advisory services are taken up by the factory.
