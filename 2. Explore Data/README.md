## Better Work combines independent enterprise assessments with enterprise advisory and training services to support practical improvements through workplace cooperation
# The main components are:
* Independent enterprise assessments for compliance with international core labour standards and national labour law
* Training and advisory services to support practical improvements

In this folder, we illustrate key functions and scripts to explore assessment and advisory data, providing an overview of the ways to examine compliance with labour standards both at the enterprise level and in aggregate terms (or by standard), and the components of Better Work's advisory services (i.e. PICC Members Report, Improvement Plan and the second Progress Report, or PR2)
